# Bike Analytics Project
This repository contains the Bike Analytics project, which focuses on analyzing bike-sharing data to gain insights into the usage patterns and behaviors of annual members and casual riders. The project aims to understand the differences between these two user groups and develop targeted marketing strategies to increase the conversion of casual riders into annual members.
