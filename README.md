# Bike Analytics Project
This repository contains the Bike Analytics project, which focuses on analysing bike-sharing data to gain insights into the usage patterns and behaviours of annual members and casual riders. The project aims to understand the differences between these two user groups and develop targeted marketing strategies to increase the conversion of casual riders into annual members.

The Data: [Cyclistic's Historical Trip Data](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)

# Project Overview
The Bike Analytics project explores the Cyclistic historical trip data to answer key questions such as how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently, why casual riders would purchase annual memberships, and how digital media can influence casual riders to become members. By analysing the data and identifying trends, the project provides valuable insights for Cyclistic's marketing team.

# Data Source
The project utilises the Cyclistic's historical trip data, which is publicly available and consists of monthly datasets for the year 2022. The data includes information such as ride duration, rideable type, start and end station details, and membership type.

# Tools and Technologies
The project leverages various tools and technologies for data analysis, including Excel, R, and MySQL. Excel is used for data visualisation and the creation of a Bike Ride Metrics Dashboard. R is employed for statistical analysis, data manipulation, and summarisation. MySQL is utilised for importing and analysing the data for consistency checks.

# Project Results
The project presents the findings and insights derived from the data analysis, including key metrics, trends, and visualisations. The Bike Ride Metrics Dashboard provides an interactive overview of the analysis results. The project also includes recommendations for marketing strategies based on the insights gained.
